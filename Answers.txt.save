1. I think we don't have to use sudo before 'node lab.js' for this
because it isn't accessing a port unlike some of our other examples

2 & 3. What lab.js is doing is printing a line called before readFile. 
It then is reading a file of plain text using the fs module and a 
callback function and displays the file name, the author, what type of 
file it is and the purpose of the file is. Before the readFile is 
called back the second line 'after readFile' is printed before the 
file is even done being read, showing that fs.readFile takes a long 
time but doesnt hold up 'after readFile' since it is async.

4. The function toString('utf8') is representing the ASCII code as a
string.

5. We don't need to use the toString because the browser can interpret the 
binary format based on the content-type.
